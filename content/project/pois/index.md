My works involve mainly:
- POIS Implementation – Implemented a PyTorch pipeline that generates a pair of target masks by fusing several network outputs.
- POIS Dataset – Generated a synthetic dataset of 6000 scenes using BlenderProc. The dataset features a variety of clutteredness and an equal distribution of graspable and suckable objects; designing a metric to select the best grasp pair. Labeled using BOP Toolkit and PyBullet.
